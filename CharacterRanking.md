## Ranking:

This is the ranking and their scores out of 140 points.

1. Ruan Mei - 134.5
2. Sparkle - 129
3. Clara - 128.5
4. Huohuo - 127
5. Topaz and Numby - 126
6. Luocha - 126
7. Jingliu - 125
8. Jing Yuan - 119.5
9. Tingyun - 119.5
10. Hanya - 118

## Standard Disclaimers:
- While I try to be as objective as I can, there might be some subjective preferences. So, don't take the scoring rules I put here too seriously/pedantically.
- To rate these units, I assume these units as "standalone" builds - meaning these units are self-sufficient and supporting allies who enable conditional builds (eg: Go for ATK Boots on ATK scaling units instead of SPD boots if you're using Sparkle) do not exist.
- My scoring baseline is based on Standard builds recommended for general playerbase (Stats that are achievable for F2P and low-spenders who are semi-serious to serious when it comes to combat and M.E.T.A)
- You get bonus points if you exceed the general playerbase builds and push towards/reach "sweaty"/potential 0-cycle builds.
- I treat the units at E0-S0/S1 for units. Eidolons and Superimpositions don't count
- If I'm objectively wrong on some accord, (not on some subjective assessments - those are always debatable) please let me know. I'll correct it.

## Scoring Rules:

### Important Overall Stats
- +10 points if you hit the minimum requirement for each stat.
- Upto +5 points if the minimum requirement is met, but did not go above and beyond.
- +5 points if the stat goes above and beyond the recommended value.
- +5 points for high HP/DEF for Support/Survival units.
- +5 points for high Effect RES on DPS/Sub-DPS units.
- +5 points for some special bonus stats.
- Maximum Score: 60/60

### Relic Main Stats
- +10 points for the best recommended mainstat on each relic.
- +8 points for conditionally good mainstats.
- +5 points for a useable but not recommended/low-priority stat
- +0 points for a bad stat
- Maximum Score: 40/40
  
### Relic Sets and LC
- +10 points for selecting the best recommended Relic/Ornament set
- +8 points if it is a 2pc + 2pc combination substitute for a 4pc set and it is very good.
- +5 points if it is a 2pc + 2pc combination substitute for a 4pc set and it is mediocre.
- +10 points for the signature LC / top-recommended 4-star LC
- +8 points for a decent 4-star LC
- +5 points for a useable 4-star LC
- Maximum Score: 30/30
  
### Personal Remarks
- Niche issues the unit might face with this build (if build permits)
- If niche issues exist, a counteracting remedy to tackle this issue.
- A personal (subjective) score out of 10.

Score: 30/30

### Personal Remarks
- There is only room for minor optimizations, which I don't think it is necessary for this unit.
- I did the calculations and having a Healing Boost body is actually better than ATK %.
- I don't see any potential/known issues.
- This Luocha is an S tier build in my humble opinion.
- Personal Score: 8/10

|Points| 10 | 10 | 10 |

Score: 30/30

### Personal Remarks
- The overall ATK can be a bit higher. There are a few bad substat rolls that didn't give ATK % unfortunately.
- There is room for some improvement, but I would not break my head over it. If you're building another unit in the future who can use 4pc AGC or 2pc Inert, then I suggest upgrading Topaz if you get lucky with better pieces.
- Since she has no Effect RES, she can be a sitting duck when fighting against enemies that debuff/disable units. I highly recommend you play her with units that either cleanse/prevent debuffs and CC effect.
- This Topaz is an S-tier build in my humble opinion.
- Personal Score: 8.5/10

|Achieved| *189.1% | 153 | 48.4% |
|Points| *15 | 15 | 15 |

* You only need 160% Break Effect as her passive gives another 20% in combat to reach the 180 % requirement threshold.
* This build gets +5 for having 189.1% Break Effect baseline, with 209.1% Break Effect in combat - all without having a Break Effect mainstat rope and for having 239.1% Break Effect after Ultimate due to the 4pc relic set passive. (This is disgustingly good)

### Personal Remarks
- There is room for some optimizations, which I don't think it is necessary for this unit. Please keep a passive look out for better pieces in the future.
- I prefer either the body or the orb to be ATK% as you're losing a decent amount of ATK boost. It is better to have HP/DEF% in her relic/ornament substats.
- Bonus points for keeping her survival into consideration.
- I don't see any potential/known issues with this unit.
- This Tingyun is an S-tier build in my humble opinion.

- There is room for some optimizations, which I don't think it is necessary for this unit. Please keep a passive look out for better pieces in the future.
- I genuinely prefer you have an ERR rope instead of a HP % Rope. (I do agree that for some people's playstyles, it may not be needed).
- Bonus points for using the "Memories of the Past" LC passive to circumvent the energy issue.
- I don't see any potential/known issues with this unit.
- This Hanya is an S-tier build in my humble opinion.
- Personal Score: 9/10

### Relic Sets and LC

Score: 28/30

### Personal Remarks
- There is room for some optimizations, which I don't think it is necessary for this unit. Please keep a passive look out for better pieces in the future.
- For Huohuo, I genuinely prefer 2pc + 2pc combinations of HP/SPD/Healing boost over 4pc Messenger. 4pc Messenger is alright, but I prefer a Harmony unit wear this than her.
- I don't see any potential/known issues with this unit.
- This Huohuo is an S-tier build in my humble opinion.

Score: 30/30

### Personal Remarks
- There is room for some improvement, but I would not break my head over it.
- Since he has no Effect RES, he can be a sitting duck when fighting against enemies that debuff/disable units. I highly recommend you play him with units that either cleanse/prevent debuffs and CC effect.
- I strongly recommend SPD Boots over ATK%.
- This Jing Yuan is an S-tier build in my humble opinion.
- Personal Score: 8.5/10
