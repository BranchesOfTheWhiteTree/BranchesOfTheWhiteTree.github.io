<h2 id="kit-introduction">Kit Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="kit-overview">Kit Overview:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Yoimiya is an ATK scaling, “Medium Female Model”, On-field Pyro
damage dealer user who wields a Bow.</li>
<li>Her kit’s signature mechanic revolves around rapid-firing enemies
with her pyro-infused normal attacks.</li>
<li>When combined with a support/sub-DPS unit who can constantly
maintain a Hydro/Electro/Dendro/Cryo aura on the enemy, you can make her
Pyro attacks constantly trigger the corresponding elemental reaction to
do a substantial amount of damage.</li>
<li>Her playstyle is quite simple as all you have to do is activate her
skill and keep using her normal attacks till it’s pyro infusion is
over.</li>
<li>As a consequence, although she is objectively weaker than Hu Tao,
her playstyle simplicity makes her highly desirable for many
players.</li>

Normal Attack | Firework Flare-up
</h2>
<h3 id="key-points">Key Points:</h3>
<ul>
<li>She deals upto 5 consecutive normal attacks dealing Physical
DMG.</li>
<li>Her N1 and N4 deal 2 instances of damage while her other attacks
deal 1 instance of damage.</li>
<li>Her N3 and N5 have the highest damage multipliers. Due to ICD,
N1-first hit, and these ones are capable of triggering the elemental
reaction and thus dealing large reaction damage.</li>
<li>Her elemental skill infuses her normal attacks with Pyro, and she
starts dealing Pyro DMG scaling off her ATK.</li>
<li>If the enemy has an elemental aura, she can make use of it and
trigger a relevant elemental reaction.</li>
<li>This is her major source of DMG and it is highly recommended to
level this up as high as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="charged-attack">Charged Attack:</h3>
<ul>
<li>She deals a standard precise aimed shot dealing Pyro DMG.</li>
<li>At charge level 1, she fires a single pyro-infused shot.</li>
<li>At charge level 2, depending on how much charge time you take, she
can launch upto 3 “kindling arrows” along with her aimed shot.</li>
<li>These kindling arrows tend to either home-in on the main target, or
sway away and hit nearby enemies or attackable entities like torches,
animals, etc.,</li>
<li>These kindling arrows deal a very small Pyro DMG.</li>
<li>For her kit, the charged attack and kindling arrows are rarely used
in combat. They are reserved almost exclusively for overworld
exploration.</li>
<li>The homing nature of her kindling arrows - when used properly - can
help attack moving targets like birds in the overworld.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="plunge-attack">Plunge Attack:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Just the regular plunge attack for bow users. It deals AoE Physical
DMG on impact. Nothing special.</li>

Elemental Skill | Niwabi Fire-Dance
</h2>
<h3 id="key-points-1">Key Points:</h3>
<ul>
<li>On activating her elemental skill, all of Yoimiya’s normal attacks
get a Pyro infusion enabling her to do Pyro DMG for 10 seconds.</li>
<li>This Pyro infusion state is called “Niwabi Enshou”.</li>
<li>You can see that her skill is active if you see few rings
surrounding her.</li>
<li>This 10 second window is vital as this is her time to dish out as
much damage as possible.</li>
<li>So, it is imperative to keep her on-field for this entire duration
and plan your team rotations for applying skills and buffs/debuffs
accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cooldown-and-energy">Cooldown and Energy:</h3>
<ul>
<li>If Yoimiya dies or she is swapped out before this state ends, the
infusion ends prematurely.</li>
<li>Post the 10 second window, she reverts to her Physical DMG normal
attacks.</li>
<li>Her skill has a cooldown of 18 seconds. So, she’ll be in her
unenhanced normal attack state for 8 seconds.</li>
<li>At this time, it’s best to swap to allies to start your next
rotation of attacks.</li>
<li>During her infused attacks, you can gain upto 4 elemental particles
in the 10-second window with a cooldown of 2 seconds between each
particle.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additional-effects">Additional Effects:</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the “Niwabi Enshou” state, Yoimiya’s charge attacks will not
produce “kindling arrows”.</li>
<li>Her skill also grants her normal attacks an additional
multiplicative damage multiplier.</li>
<li>Since the multiplier is a decent boost that plateaus at higher
talent levels, it is recommended to atleast level her skill upto 6.</li>

<img width="50" src=/images/Genshin/characters/talent_icons/Yoimiya/Burst.webp />
Elemental Burst | Ryuukin Saxifrage
</h2>
<h3 id="key-points-2">Key Points:</h3>
<ul>
<li>She leaps into the air and deals an AoE Pyro DMG on the
enemies.</li>
<li>After that, she marks one enemy with a status effect called “Aurous
Blaze” for 10 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="aurous-blaze">Aurous Blaze:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Any ally other than Yoimiya attacking the enemy marked by Aurous
Blaze will trigger an AoE Pyro DMG. This damage proc can be triggered
once every 2 seconds.</li>
<li>Each proc of Aurous Blaze deals nearly the same damage as her
elemental burst attack’s first hit.</li>
<li>Yoimiya CANNOT trigger Aurous Blaze procs. So, it is recommended to
swap to other allies after launching Yoimiya’s burst to take advantage
of this damage.</li>
<li>If the enemy marked by Aurous Blaze dies before the 10 second
duration, the mark will pass on to a nearby opponent for the remainder
of the duration.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="low-priority-talent">Low Priority Talent:</h3>
<ul>
<li>In her entire kit, this talent has the lowest priority. Although you
need this talent at higher levels to maximize her kit’s damage, many
players prefer to keep this talent at lower levels or completely ignore
it.</li>
<li>This is especially the case when people use the 4pc Shimenawa set on
her over the 4pc Crimson set.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="potential-to-miss-the-target">Potential to miss the target:</h3>
<ul>
<li>If the enemy moves during the burst animation, it is totally
possible for the enemy to dodge the burst and not get the mark. So, be
mindful of enemy motion when casting the burst.</li>

<li>Yoimiya’s skill enhanced Pyro Normal attacks will give 2% Pyro DMG
bonus to her on hit.</li>
<li>She can gain upto 10 stacks of this, with each stack lasting for 3
seconds.</li>

<li>This does not apply to Yoimiya.</li>
<li>Also, the allies get 1% additional ATK bonus for every stack of
“Tricks of the trouble-maker” she has.</li>

the on-field ally/team mate with a small boost.</li>
