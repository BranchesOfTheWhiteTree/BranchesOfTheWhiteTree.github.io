## Kit Introduction


### Kit Overview:
* Yoimiya is an ATK scaling, "Medium Female Model", On-field Pyro damage dealer user who wields a Bow.
* Her kit's signature mechanic revolves around rapid-firing enemies with her pyro-infused normal attacks.
* When combined with a support/sub-DPS unit who can constantly maintain a Hydro/Electro/Dendro/Cryo aura on the enemy, you can make her Pyro attacks constantly trigger the corresponding elemental reaction to do a substantial amount of damage.
* Her playstyle is quite simple as all you have to do is activate her skill and keep using her normal attacks till it's pyro infusion is over.
* As a consequence, although she is objectively weaker than Hu Tao, her playstyle simplicity makes her highly desirable for many players.

### Key Points:
* She deals upto 5 consecutive normal attacks dealing Physical DMG.
* Her N1 and N4 deal 2 instances of damage while her other attacks deal 1 instance of damage.
* Her N3 and N5 have the highest damage multipliers. Due to ICD, N1-first hit, and these ones are capable of triggering the elemental reaction and thus dealing large reaction damage.
* Her elemental skill infuses her normal attacks with Pyro, and she starts dealing Pyro DMG scaling off her ATK.
* If the enemy has an elemental aura, she can make use of it and trigger a relevant elemental reaction.
* This is her major source of DMG and it is highly recommended to level this up as high as possible.

### Charged Attack:
* She deals a standard precise aimed shot dealing Pyro DMG.
* At charge level 1, she fires a single pyro-infused shot.
* At charge level 2, depending on how much charge time you take, she can launch upto 3 "kindling arrows" along with her aimed shot.
* These kindling arrows tend to either home-in on the main target, or sway away and hit nearby enemies or attackable entities like torches, animals, etc.,
* These kindling arrows deal a very small Pyro DMG.
* For her kit, the charged attack and kindling arrows are rarely used in combat. They are reserved almost exclusively for overworld exploration.
* The homing nature of her kindling arrows - when used properly - can help attack moving targets like birds in the overworld.

### Plunge Attack:
* Just the regular plunge attack for bow users. It deals AoE Physical DMG on impact. Nothing special.

### Key Points:
* On activating her elemental skill, all of Yoimiya's normal attacks get a Pyro infusion enabling her to do Pyro DMG for 10 seconds.
* This Pyro infusion state is called "Niwabi Enshou".
* You can see that her skill is active if you see few rings surrounding her.
* This 10 second window is vital as this is her time to dish out as much damage as possible.
* So, it is imperative to keep her on-field for this entire duration and plan your team rotations for applying skills and buffs/debuffs accordingly.

### Cooldown and Energy:
* If Yoimiya dies or she is swapped out before this state ends, the infusion ends prematurely.
* Post the 10 second window, she reverts to her Physical DMG normal attacks.
* Her skill has a cooldown of 18 seconds. So, she'll be in her unenhanced normal attack state for 8 seconds.
* At this time, it's best to swap to allies to start your next rotation of attacks.
* During her infused attacks, you can gain upto 4 elemental particles in the 10-second window with a cooldown of 2 seconds between each particle.

### Additional Effects:
* In the "Niwabi Enshou" state, Yoimiya's charge attacks will not produce "kindling arrows".
* Her skill also grants her normal attacks an additional multiplicative damage multiplier.
* Since the multiplier is a decent boost that plateaus at higher talent levels, it is recommended to atleast level her skill upto 6.

### Key Points:
* She leaps into the air and deals an AoE Pyro DMG on the enemies.
* After that, she marks one enemy with a status effect called "Aurous Blaze" for 10 seconds.

### Aurous Blaze:
* Any ally other than Yoimiya attacking the enemy marked by Aurous Blaze will trigger an AoE Pyro DMG. This damage proc can be triggered once every 2 seconds.
* Each proc of Aurous Blaze deals nearly the same damage as her elemental burst attack's first hit.
* Yoimiya CANNOT trigger Aurous Blaze procs. So, it is recommended to swap to other allies after launching Yoimiya's burst to take advantage of this damage.
* If the enemy marked by Aurous Blaze dies before the 10 second duration, the mark will pass on to a nearby opponent for the remainder of the duration.

### Low Priority Talent:
* In her entire kit, this talent has the lowest priority. Although you need this talent at higher levels to maximize her kit's damage, many players prefer to keep this talent at lower levels or completely ignore it.
* This is especially the case when people use the 4pc Shimenawa set on her over the 4pc Crimson set.

### Potential to miss the target:
* If the enemy moves during the burst animation, it is totally possible for the enemy to dodge the burst and not get the mark. So, be mindful of enemy motion when casting the burst.

* Yoimiya's skill enhanced Pyro Normal attacks will give 2% Pyro DMG bonus to her on hit.
* She can gain upto 10 stacks of this, with each stack lasting for 3 seconds.
* This is a mild damage boosting ascension ability.

* Using her Ultimate gives the nearby party members a 10% ATK boost for 15 seconds.
* This does not apply to Yoimiya.
* Also, the allies get 1% additional ATK bonus for every stack of "Tricks of the trouble-maker" she has.
* This is a mild damage boosting ability for the team. It incentivises the on-field ally/team mate with a small boost.

* When Yoimiya crafts Decoration, Ornament, and Landscape-type Furnishings, she has a 100% chance to refund a portion of the materials used.
* This passive has no use in combat.
* For all the teapot enthusiats, this passive is useful as she can refund upto 25% of the total number of materials used to craft an item in the teapot.
