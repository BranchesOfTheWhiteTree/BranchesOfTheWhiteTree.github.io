<h1 align="center">Arlecchino - Dire Balemoon</h1><img src=https://branchesofthewhitetree.github.io/images/Genshin/characters/gacha/Arlecchino.jpg class="d-block w-100" alt="...">

## Kit Introduction


### Kit Overview 1:
* Arlecchino is an ATK scaling, "Tall Female Model" , on-field pyro hypercarry who wields a polearm.
* Her gimmick revolves around a relatively new mechanic called "Bond of Life" which prevents the character from being healed and only can be healed when the Bond of Life is "healed".
* However, in Arlecchino's case, she has a passive talent in which she won't be able to gain healing from her teammates outside of battle.

### Kit Overview 2:
* Playing Arlecchino becomes a soulsborne game where players have to be careful of how they play her as dodging/getting hit will result in massive damage lost and potentially death.
* She is a standard hypercarry, similar to hu tao, but unlike her, she does not need to spam charged attacks. Instead, her normal attack is her main source of damage.
* In summary, she is a complex character as while her damage output is high, her survivability is on the other end of the spectrum. She is the definition of a glass cannon; high risk, high reward.
* With her release, many questions if she will powercreep hu tao. Comparing to hu tao, Arlecchino can be played in overload team, especially with chevreuse released, while hu tao, although may find usage in overload team, doesn't perform as great as Arlecchino. Both vaporize comps are really strong, so it depends on the player roster/builds to see which is better than which.

## Normal Attack - Invitation to a Beheading


### Key Points:
* She performs up to 6 consecutive spear strikes dealing physical damage

### Charged Attack:
* She consumes stamina in order to dash forward to the nearest enemy, dealing physical damage.
* If the player chooses to hold the charged attack, Arlecchino will sprint for up to 5 seconds, similar to wanderer and yelan's skill

### Plunging Attack:
* A regular plunge dealing AoE damage.

### Masque of the Red Death:
* Her special mechanic. When Arlecchino has a Bond of Life equal to or greater than 30% of her Max HP, she will enter the "Masque of Red Death" state. In this state, her normal, charged and plunged attacks will be infused with pyro dmg which cannot be overridden.
* In this state, Arlecchino's Normal Attacks will have an additional multiplier that scales of her ATK and her current Bond of Life. While doing her Normal Attacks, her Bond of Life will be consumed and her skill cooldown will be reduced.

## Elemental Skill - All is Ash


### Key Points:
* Upon activation, she deals AoE pyro DMG to nearby enemies and performs a dash attack to one of them, dealing AoE pyro DMG. Enemies that were hit by such an attack will have a Blood-Debt Directive applied to them.

### Blood-Debt Directive:
* This lasts 30s. Every 5 seconds after its applied, it will deal Pyro DMG to the enemy up to 2 times. This DMG will be considered an Elemental Skill DMG.
* When Arlecchino does a Charged Attack or Elemental Burst, she will absorb and clear any Blood-Debt Directives. Each Directive absorbed grants her a Bond of Life worth 65% of her Max HP, to a maximum of 145% within 35 seconds. Using her skill within this will restart the countdown and the limit of the value of Bond of Life gained by Blood-Debt Directives.
* A bunch of information was launched in front of us. To keep it simple, she applies a pyro DoT, similar to Hu Tao's Blood Blossom, which overtime will be leveled up due to her A2. She can absorb such marks and she will gain a massive amount of Bond of Life which she can used to be in her "Masque of Red Death" state. This is key to her main source of damage and should be used at the start of the rotation, let it cook, and at the end absorb it and deal massive damage.

## Elemental Burst - Balemoon Rising


### Key Points:
* Arlecchino will absorb and clear any Blood-Debt Directives, dealing massive AoE Pyro DMG. It also reset the cooldown of her skill and healing her based on her Bond of Life value and ATK.
* Standard nuke damage and also being her only source of healing. While many players would want to use her burst so as to heal and survive, the truth is using her burst every rotation will result in a massive damage loss. Also, if players want to burst every rotation, Arlecchino would need to have alot of energy recharge which will result in a lower damage output as artifacts stat rolls will be invested in energy recharge and not offensive stats. In summary, players should refrain from using her burst and only use it when necessary.

## Ascension Ability A1: Agony Alone May Be Repaid

* Blood-Debt Directives have the following characteristics.
* Defeating an opponent with a Directive, Arlecchino will gain a Bond of Life worth 130% of her Max HP.
* 5 seconds after a Directive is applied, it will be upgraded to a Blood-Debt Due. When absorbed, it will instead grant Arlecchino a Bond of Life worth 130%.
* A Bond of Life created in the aforementioned ways cannot exceed the original limit on the value of Bonds of Life obtained through All Is Ash.- This is a massive quality of life for Arlecchino as she is able to gain a huge amount of Bond of Life which will help her in her damage. However, defeating an enemy with a Directive may be hard as against bosses, such a situation may not happen.
* Players should use her skill at the start of the rotation, swap out to support to set them up, let the Directive upgrade to Blood-Debt Due, and lastly swapped to Arlecchino to absorb and gain the 130% Bond of Life.

## Ascension Ability A4: Strength Alone Can Defend

* Arlecchino gains 1% All Elemental and Physical RES for every 100 ATK she has in excess of 1,000. The maximum RES increase she can gain this way for each is 20%.
* This will help Arlecchino slightly in her endurance and survivability.

## Ascension Ability A0: The Balemoon Alone May Know

* While in combat, Arlecchino gains a 40% Pyro DMG Bonus and can only be healed through Balemoon Rising.
* An offensive passive talent which other characters don't have. Gained a respectable amount of Pyro DMG Bonus in exchange of only being healed outside of battle.
