Arlecchino - Dire Balemoon

<p><img src=https://branchesofthewhitetree.github.io/images/Genshin/characters/gacha/Arlecchino.jpg class="d-block w-100" alt="..."></p>
<h2 id="kit-introduction">Kit Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="kit-overview-1">Kit Overview 1:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Arlecchino is an ATK scaling, “Tall Female Model” , on-field pyro
hypercarry who wields a polearm.</li>
<li>Her gimmick revolves around a relatively new mechanic called “Bond
of Life” which prevents the character from being healed and only can be
healed when the Bond of Life is “healed”.</li>
<li>However, in Arlecchino’s case, she has a passive talent in which she
won’t be able to gain healing from her teammates outside of battle.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="kit-overview-2">Kit Overview 2:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Playing Arlecchino becomes a soulsborne game where players have to
be careful of how they play her as dodging/getting hit will result in
massive damage lost and potentially death.</li>
<li>She is a standard hypercarry, similar to hu tao, but unlike her, she
does not need to spam charged attacks. Instead, her normal attack is her
main source of damage.</li>
<li>In summary, she is a complex character as while her damage output is
high, her survivability is on the other end of the spectrum. She is the
definition of a glass cannon; high risk, high reward.</li>
<li>With her release, many questions if she will powercreep hu tao.
Comparing to hu tao, Arlecchino can be played in overload team,
especially with chevreuse released, while hu tao, although may find
usage in overload team, doesn’t perform as great as Arlecchino. Both
vaporize comps are really strong, so it depends on the player
roster/builds to see which is better than which.</li>

<h2 id="normal-attack---invitation-to-a-beheading">Normal Attack -
Invitation to a Beheading</h2>
<h3 id="key-points">Key Points:</h3>
<ul>
<li>She performs up to 6 consecutive spear strikes dealing physical
damage</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="charged-attack">Charged Attack:</h3>
<ul>
<li>She consumes stamina in order to dash forward to the nearest enemy,
dealing physical damage.</li>
<li>If the player chooses to hold the charged attack, Arlecchino will
sprint for up to 5 seconds, similar to wanderer and yelan’s skill</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="plunging-attack">Plunging Attack:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A regular plunge dealing AoE damage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="masque-of-the-red-death">Masque of the Red Death:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Her special mechanic. When Arlecchino has a Bond of Life equal to or
greater than 30% of her Max HP, she will enter the “Masque of Red Death”
state. In this state, her normal, charged and plunged attacks will be
infused with pyro dmg which cannot be overridden.</li>
<li>In this state, Arlecchino’s Normal Attacks will have an additional
multiplier that scales of her ATK and her current Bond of Life. While
doing her Normal Attacks, her Bond of Life will be consumed and her
skill cooldown will be reduced.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="Skill" class="tab-pane">
<h2 id="elemental-skill---all-is-ash">Elemental Skill - All is Ash</h2>
<h3 id="key-points-1">Key Points:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Upon activation, she deals AoE pyro DMG to nearby enemies and
performs a dash attack to one of them, dealing AoE pyro DMG. Enemies
that were hit by such an attack will have a Blood-Debt Directive applied
to them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="blood-debt-directive">Blood-Debt Directive:</h3>
<ul>
<li>This lasts 30s. Every 5 seconds after its applied, it will deal Pyro
DMG to the enemy up to 2 times. This DMG will be considered an Elemental
Skill DMG.</li>
<li>When Arlecchino does a Charged Attack or Elemental Burst, she will
absorb and clear any Blood-Debt Directives. Each Directive absorbed
grants her a Bond of Life worth 65% of her Max HP, to a maximum of 145%
within 35 seconds. Using her skill within this will restart the
countdown and the limit of the value of Bond of Life gained by
Blood-Debt Directives.</li>
<li>A bunch of information was launched in front of us. To keep it
simple, she applies a pyro DoT, similar to Hu Tao’s Blood Blossom, which
overtime will be leveled up due to her A2. She can absorb such marks and
she will gain a massive amount of Bond of Life which she can used to be
in her “Masque of Red Death” state. This is key to her main source of
damage and should be used at the start of the rotation, let it cook, and
at the end absorb it and deal massive damage.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="tab-content">
<div id="Burst" class="tab-pane">
<h2 id="elemental-burst---balemoon-rising">Elemental Burst - Balemoon
Rising</h2>
<h3 id="key-points-2">Key Points:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Arlecchino will absorb and clear any Blood-Debt Directives, dealing
massive AoE Pyro DMG. It also reset the cooldown of her skill and
healing her based on her Bond of Life value and ATK.</li>
<li>Standard nuke damage and also being her only source of healing.
While many players would want to use her burst so as to heal and
survive, the truth is using her burst every rotation will result in a
massive damage loss. Also, if players want to burst every rotation,
Arlecchino would need to have alot of energy recharge which will result
in a lower damage output as artifacts stat rolls will be invested in
energy recharge and not offensive stats. In summary, players should
refrain from using her burst and only use it when necessary.</li>

<h2 id="ascension-ability-a1-agony-alone-may-be-repaid">Ascension
Ability A1: Agony Alone May Be Repaid</h2>
<ul>
<li>Blood-Debt Directives have the following characteristics.</li>
<li>Defeating an opponent with a Directive, Arlecchino will gain a Bond
of Life worth 130% of her Max HP.</li>
<li>5 seconds after a Directive is applied, it will be upgraded to a
Blood-Debt Due. When absorbed, it will instead grant Arlecchino a Bond
of Life worth 130%.</li>
<li>A Bond of Life created in the aforementioned ways cannot exceed the
original limit on the value of Bonds of Life obtained through All Is
Ash.- This is a massive quality of life for Arlecchino as she is able to
gain a huge amount of Bond of Life which will help her in her damage.
However, defeating an enemy with a Directive may be hard as against
bosses, such a situation may not happen.</li>
<li>Players should use her skill at the start of the rotation, swap out
to support to set them up, let the Directive upgrade to Blood-Debt Due,
and lastly swapped to Arlecchino to absorb and gain the 130% Bond of
Life.</li>

<ul>
<li>Arlecchino gains 1% All Elemental and Physical RES for every 100 ATK
she has in excess of 1,000. The maximum RES increase she can gain this
way for each is 20%.</li>
<li>This will help Arlecchino slightly in her endurance and
survivability.</li>

<li>While in combat, Arlecchino gains a 40% Pyro DMG Bonus and can only
be healed through Balemoon Rising.</li>
<li>An offensive passive talent which other characters don’t have.
Gained a respectable amount of Pyro DMG Bonus in exchange of only being
healed outside of battle.</li>
