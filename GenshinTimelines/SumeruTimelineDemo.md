    She arrives on Sumeru. She is a Seelie survivor.
    She wandered the desert for 72 days bare foot.
    Wherever her foot bleeded, apparently rivers flew.
    She created a mystical elemental species called 'Jinn'.
    The Jinn were completely devoted to Nabu Malikata and called her their 'Mistress'.]

    These two together created the city 'Ay-Khanoum' with the Jinn.
    'Ay-Khanoum' is known as the 'City of Jinn'. It was replete with purple 'Padisarah' flowers.
    It was also technologically comparable to Deshret's kingdom.]

    It stands for reasonable speculation that Rukkhadevata might've been created in the same way Nahida was created.
    Not much is known about Rukkhadevata when she was a child till she became an adult.
    It is inferred that her consciousness is linked to the Irminsul tree right from birth.]

    Countless beautiful purple 'Padisarah' flowers blossomed all over the land.
    From that day onwards, Rukkhadevata's birthday was celebrated as 'Sabzeruz' festival.
    This feat of Nabu Malikata is central to the 'Sabzeruz' festival.
    Nabu Malikata was called 'Goddess of Flowers' for this feat and her previous feats.
    Several years/decades later, Celestia contacts Deshret and proposes to give him a 'Gnosis'.
    Deshret refuses the 'Gnosis' and tells Celestia that the three gods will co-rule Sumeru.]

    A05[It is implied/speculated that King Deshret had a liking for Nabu Malikata
    Along with his implied liking for Nabu Malikata, Deshret hated the Celestia's rule.
    He openly had many discussions with Nabu Malikata to learn skills and knowledge about the truth of this world.
    Although hesitant at first, Nabu Malikata relented and shared many 'secrets' of Celestia.
    Nabu told about the Heavenly Principles, how Celestia rains celestial nails across the land to subdue major forbidden knowledge incidents.
    Nabu also told about how Celestia destroys civilizations who violated its rule.
    Nabu finally told about the Abyssal Power/Forbidden Knowledge to Deshret.
    At his repeated request, Nabu Malikata also shared to him some methods to harness the Forbidden Knowledge.
    Nabu Malikata knew her time is short. It is implied that she had the power to forsee future.
    She foresaw the destruction of 'Ay-Khanoum'.
    The city Ay-Khanoum got destroyed as she foresaw, and only Deshret and some Jinn came alive unscathed.]

    She foresaw a major calamity in the distant future that will be a major challenge to Sumeru and the whole world.
    She creates a wooden bird called 'Simurgh' and leaves it in the hands of Rukkhadevata.
    She tells Simurgh that Rukkhadevata is a much more virtuous and better person than she can ever be.
    Nabu Malikata died with the downfall of Ay-Khanoum.]
