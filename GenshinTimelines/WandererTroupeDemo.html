    subgraph Goblet["Goblet"];
    A01[A strangely-shaped kettle that plays a wondrous tune as the water flows out.
    There was always music in the life of a Troupe member, even when drinking water.
    An ancient tale tells of a wandering troupe that roamed the land.
    For flutes they had swords, and for harps they had bows.
    They performed not only for friends, but also for foes.
    They traveled through the desert and set foot in the blazing Mare Jivari.
    The tune of the harp echoing in the kettle was a reminder for them.
    'Along with the boundless tunes we walk.'
    'Wherever there is music, there is us.'
    ]
    end

    subgraph Flower["Flower"];
    B01[A small flower-shaped insignia. There seems to be music coming from it.
    Among the members of the troupe was a charismatic swordswoman.
    Beautiful as the light on water, elegant as the chirping lark.
    Her every slash hummed a tune of the wind.
    The end of each song and dance was like the sun after the rain.
    Dust has since settled, and both the stage and life itself feel emptier for the absence of her music.
    Both her music and her sword were as lethal as they were beautiful.
    This was in keeping with the troupe's performances, which were intended for two very different audiences.
    For the audience of foes, the music drifted far beyond the stage.]
    end

    subgraph Circlet["Circlet"];
    C01[An azure arrow fletching that has survived the test of time.
    The fletching seems to produce a tune as the arrow flies through air.
    The harpist of the troupe was also a skilled archer.
    Legend has it that he could lure the birds in the sky with his harp and shoot them down with his arrows.
    It is said that he never looked at the sky while he was playing the harp to lure the birds.
    Some believed the reason was his harpist's arrogance, while his companion said it was his hunter's mercy.
    The ill-fated birds became the fletching of the harpist's arrows,
    and the sound of the harp became the birds' elegy.]
