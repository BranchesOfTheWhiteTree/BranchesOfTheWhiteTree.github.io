## A Path Through the Storm

### Next Location
The traveler approaches the Northern Teleport Waypoint of Liyue Harbor, from where they could oversee the whole of Liyue Harbor. They are shocked and surprised by their sibling joining the Abyss, and how they should "reach the end of their journey" before they could meet their sibling once again.

Paimon tells the traveler to not lose hope and encourages us to move forward, for which the traveler is happy and says they are glad to have Paimon as their guide.

Traveler still wants to find the unknown god (Sustainer of Heavenly Principles) that separated the them and their twin sibling, and is keen on getting answers from her and teach a lesson she won't forget.

After ruling out the Anemo and Geo Archons, they decide to go to Inazuma to meet the Electro Archon. Since Inazuma is a ckosed nation, entering it would be hard. But Paimon and the Traveler remembered meeting an Inazuman NPC named Atsuko in Liyue. So they both meet her.

### Meeting Atsuko
Atsuko tells the Traveler and Paimon that getting into Inazuma is quite hard. She herself left Inazuma to escape her pursuers on a self-assembled wooden raft and sailed through the dangerous sea with raging storms.

Eventually, she ran out of water and food, and floated aimlessly on the ocean and even blacked out. Fortunately for her, someone rescued her and she reached Liyue and started life anew.

Atsuko left Inazuma as everything over there was becoming quite restrictive
