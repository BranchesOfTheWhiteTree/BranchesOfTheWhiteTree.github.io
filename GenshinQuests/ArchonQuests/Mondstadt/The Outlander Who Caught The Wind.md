>***Quest Description: The god took away your only kin, and you were sealed and cast into a deep slumber. Upon your awakening, you wandered alone for a time until you met a strange companion named Paimon, thus beginning your journey through the continent of Teyvat...***

For reasons unknown, Traveler and their twin have been on a long journey, traveling through countless worlds, seeing the birth and death of stars as they passed them by. Until, one day, hoping to enjoy the journey across the new world, they descended upon a continent named Teyvat, unbeknownst of what was to come.

Awoken amidst fallen stars, Traveler saw the world in a tohubohu amidst the Cataclysm. Trying to leave and move to the next world, the siblings' path is blocked by an Unknown Goddess and, try as they might to fight, they were no match for the being before them. As such, this God took away the golden-haired outlander’s only kin while sealing Traveler and their power, casting them in a deep slumber filled with nightmares.

Unknown amount of time later, Traveler reawakens and, seeking the deity they once saw, begins their new journey. Two months later, they meet Paimon, catching her out of the water while fishing, most likely saving her from drowning. So, as thanks, she decides to be Traveler’s guide through Teyvat.

>***Quest Description: You begin your journey in Starfell Valley, exploring the land and seeing its sights together with Paimon.***

After relaying their story to her, the adventurer and their companion make their way towards the closest Statue of the Seven. Paimon explains that this world has 7 deities who rule the 7 nations of Teyvat, known as Archons. Among them, the one who was depicted on the statue before them was the Anemo Archon, god with control over the wind.

>***Quest Description: As you advanced, a Statue of the Seven appeared on the horizon ahead of you. At Paimon's suggestion, you go to investigate.***

Upon touching the statue, for unknown reasons, Traveler gets the powers of Anemo.

Having finished investigating the Statue, Paimon’s suggest heading west towards Mondstadt, the city of Freedom and Wind that worships Anemo Archon, as such, they might get some clues there.

## Forest Rendezvous

>***Quest Description: Unexpectedly, the power of Anemo within the Statue of the Seven resonated with you. You decided to begin your investigation with the Anemo Archon of Teyvat's Seven Archons. As such, the first order of the day is to reach the land under the Anemo Archon's protection: Mondstadt.***

On their way, the pair spots a big dragon flying towards a nearby forest, so they decide to follow it. In the heart of said forest, they see a mysterious person seemingly trying to pacify the dragon, but, after sensing the Traveler, both the person in green and the azure dragon run away. In a place where the 2 just were, the companions find a teardrop crystal with a gloomy red glow, which they decide to put away for now.

>***Quest Description: On the path to Mondstadt, you inadvertently eavesdropped on a meeting between a huge dragon and a mysterious figure. As you proceeded with various doubts in mind, a perky young girl showed up to block your path.***

Soon after leaving the forest, Traveler and Paimon encounter an energetic girl who introduces herself as Amber, Outrider for the Knights of Favonius. A bit distrustful at first, she agrees to help the two reach Mondstadt safely after she deals with a Hilihcurl threat nearby, which Traveler helps her with in return.

>***Quest Description: The girl's name is Amber, and her duty as an Outrider is to escort you to Mondstadt. However, she has another task to attend to first, which is to clean out the hilichurls that have been wandering around outside the city.***

After clearing out the monster camp, the girl in red explains that Hilichurls has been getting closer to the city because of the dragon’s - Stormterror’s - actions lately. 

## City of Freedom

>***Quest Description: With your help, the problem was resolved quickly. Led by Amber, you reach the city of freedom — Mondstadt.***

Having reached the city, Amber officially welcomes two travelers to Mondstadt, the city of wind, dandelions, and freedom, and mentions the Knights of Favonius and their Acting Grand Master Jean who’re trying to resolve the current crisis with the Stormterror. Before leading the pair to the Knights’ headquarters, however, Amber gifts a Wind Glider to the Traveler, who decides to take it for a spin. 

## Dragon Storm

>***Quest Description: The usually-peaceful Mondstadt was suddenly assailed by a dragon. This is the Stormterror that Amber spoke of, and was the gigantic creature that you encountered in the forest earlier.***

Yet, as soon as they finish their test flight, the Mondstadt is suddenly stormed by the dragon from before, and Traveler is swept up by one of the tornadoes. Using their wind glider, Traveler discovers that they stay afloat in the air, not falling, and a mysterious voice they hear helps them fend off Stormterror.

Upon landing, Amber hurries towards them. As the trio meets, they are approached by a one-eyed man, whom Amber introduces as Kaeya, Knights of Favonius Cavalry Captain. After repeating their story up until now to him, Kaeya thanks them for helping out the situation and takes them to the Knight’s HQ as per Acting Grand Master’s invitation.

## Knights of Favonius

>***Quest Description: You repelled Stormterror with some difficulty. Kaeya of the Knights of Favonius witnessed the battle, and you were invited to make a trip to the Knights headquarters.***

Inside, the group is met by Jean and Lisa, the resident Librarian. Bringing everyone up to speed on Traveler’s situation, Jean suggests that they repose in Mondstadt until the situation with the dragon is dealt with, after which they will help the outlander look for their sibling. Yet Traveler extends their help, which is hurriedly accepted.

During strategizing, it’s revealed that Lisa pinpointed the source of Stormterror’s power in abandoned Four Winds’ Temples. As such, their next course of action is to clear out three out of four temples, though nobody explains why one of the temples is exempt. Amber, Kaeya, and Lisa go to a temple each while Traveler will assist each one of them.

## Winds of the Past

![Winds of the Past](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gensin-impact/images/8/80/Archon_Quest_C0A1_Winds_of_the_Past.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20231208015258)

>***Quest Description: To stop Stormterror's siege, you must venture out and eliminate the elemental flows left within the ruined Temples of the Four Winds. Amber is waiting for you at the Temple of the Falcon.***

While helping with the Temple of Falcon, Amber explains that these temples have been abandoned for a long time and, nowadays, no one ever comes here anymore. She also mentions that Stormterror was, at one point, one of the Four Winds, though he had abandoned his own temple now. As parting words, Amber suggests that Traveler ask Lisa if they want to learn more about the Four Winds and history of Mondstadt.

## Crash Course

>***Quest Description: Kaeya will accompany you to explore the Temple of the Wolf.***

The clearout of the Temple of Wolf with Kaeya goes without a hitch, and the Cavalry Captain sends Traveler and Paimon to the next temple while he will handle the rest in here. After they leave, however, Kaeya confronts the actual mastermind behind the Hilichurl ambush—an Abyss Mage. Yet, as soon as the Mage reveals themselves, it is attacked by a suddenly appeared red-haired man, whom Kaeya seems to know.

## Sparks Amongst the Pages

>***Quest Description: Lisa is in charge of clearing the Deep Within the Temple of the Lion alongside you.***

Having met up with Lisa and making their way through the Temple of Lion, the librarian explains to Traveler what Visions, the gem that they saw on multiple people thus far, are. She likens it to a “magical lightning rod” that allows the chosen ones to draw on elemental powers. Having destroyed the source of Stormterror’s power, Lisa also talks about all Four Winds: Dragon of the East, Lion of the South, Wolf of the North, and Falcon of the West, who are affiliated with the Anemo Archon, Barbatos. Among them, Stormterror was the Dragon of the East, and its real name is Dvalin. Thus, the reason only three temples were handled is because Dvalin was already consuming its own power. As for why one of the Four Winds turned against Mondstadt, Lisa gifts the book called “Breeze Amidst the Forest Supplement: The Dragon Tome” to the Traveler, which, she says, will clear things up.

After clearing out the temples, the leylines and elemental flow get back to normal, and Paimon suggests heading back to the Knights of Favonius HQ to meet up with everyone and see what to do next.
