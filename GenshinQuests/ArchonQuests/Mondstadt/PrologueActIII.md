## Prologue: Act III - Song of the Dragon and Freedom

#### 1. Abyss Mage
##### Quest Description: You used the Holy Lyre der Himmel to summon Stormterror, only to be prevented from saving it due to the interference of the Abyss Order. But you haven't given up yet â€” Diluc has been able to swiftly obtain a new lead...

Through his connections, Diluc has managed to dig up a few clues about the Abyss Order. Jean, Venti, Traveller and Paimon have come to Dawn Winery to discuss their next course of action.

However, Venti has yet to answer a question: Why does the great Anemo God Barbatos require the help of mere humans?
Venti explains that "The Seven" as people now know, were once known as "The Seven Archons", and only by fulfilling their role in presiding over their part of Teyvet can they attain power. As for Venti, he does not like the idea of "ruling" Mondstadt, and he believes that Mondstadt would not like it either. 
"Go forth and establish a city of freedom without rule," that was Barbatos' wish for the people of Mondstadt.
Venti confesses that he has not been back to Mondstadt for an extended period of time, claiming to now be the weakest archon among The Seven. 
All in all, he now requires Mondstadt's help to save their dragon, Dvalin.

Getting back to the matter at hand, they had tracked down the Abyss Mage to the vicinity of the winery. After defeating it, they realised that a certain energy dispersed from its body, cutting off the connection between Venti and Dvalin. According to Venti, after Dvalin had awoken, he took the ancient ruins of Old Monstadt as his lair, Stormterror's Lair. The entrance to the ruins was sealed by a special storm barrier, and from the dispersed energy, Venti was able to read the rhythmic flow of how the barrier's magic was woven, which should be enough for them to break through. This meant that they had to confront Dvalin. Fortunately, they do not need to slay Dvalin just yet, for they still had the Traveler as their trump card. With the Traveller's mystical capabilities, they have a chance in purifying the Abyssal curse that binds Dvalin. This upcoming battle is going to require everyone's efforts for our heroes to succeed and save Dvalin.

#### 2. Hurdle
##### Quest Description: You came to Stormterror's Lair to once again attempt Dvalin's rescue. However, it is surrounded by wind barriers made by Stormterror, and the dark forces at work have no intention of letting you break through those barriers so easily.

At the entrance to Stormterror's Lair, our heroes were ambushed by a group of hilichurls. Typically, hilichurls do not venture into areas with high elemental concentrations for it puts a heavy burden on their bodies. Thus, the Abyss Order must be manipulating them behind the scenes, spreading their forces to halt their plans. 

After defeating the hilichurls, Venti dispersed the storm barrier by playing the lyre, opening the entrance to Stormterror's Lair.

#### 3. Empty Abode
Our heroes took a wind current up towards the top of the tower, finding some ancient seals that blocked their path. Venti shared that these ancient ruins were once part of an anicent city that predates the existence of The Four Winds. Monstadt is a city without a ruler, however, it was once ruled over by a tyrant. 

#### 4. Light Guiding Ceremony
##### Quest Description: The entrance to Stormterror's Lair is just ahead, but the light seals bar the way in. You must once again face a trial in order to break those seals.

After successfully unlocking all three light actuators, our heroes venture deeper into Stormterror's Lair.

#### 5. Calm Before the Storm
##### Quest Desciption: The three light seals have each been broken by you in their turn, and the path to the decisive showdown is open. You once again return to the lair's entrance to put an end to things.

Thinking back on how far they had come, Venti was thinking about turning these adventures into songs that will hopefully be sung for years to come by the people of Mondstadt, just like The Legend of Vennessa. Each and every one of our heroes had their own reasons for joining this party to the end. For Diluc, the group had shared many secrets with him, so he intended to return their trust to the same extent by helping them to the end. For Jean, it was her duty and responsibility as Acting Grand Master and Dandelion Knight that drove her to put an end to all of this. For Venti, it was "freedom". Monstadt is the City of Freedom, without the reign of a king. He hoped that the dragon that once protected Monstadt will soon be free too. No one should have deceived him by telling him that Mondstadt had betrayed him, and no one should had told him that it was his eternal duty to protect the city. He had the right and freedoom to choose his own way of life.

With that said, it was time to face Dvalin. May the thousands of years of wind that have flown through Monstadt go with you, Traveller.

#### 6. A Long Shot
##### Quest Description: After a long and daring pursuit of Dvalin, who has been led astray by the Abyss Mages, you are about to finally confront him once and for all.

With Venti's Anemo powers, Traveller rode the winds to reach Dvalin, removing the two poisonous blood clots on his back that coagulated on his wounds. After defeating Stormterror, the platforms crumble, causing everyone to fall. Fortunately, Dvalin saved them all.

Dvalin did not understand why Venti had not asked him to protect him like the last time, to which Venti responded that him not wanting Dvalin to listen to the Abyss Order did not mean that he had to listen to him. 
"Freedom, if demanded of you by an archon, is really no freedom at all."
With Venti's blessing, Dvalin is finally free.

With the Stormterror threat quelled and peace restored, it was time for our heroes to return to Mondstadt. 

#### 7. When the Wind Dies Down
##### Quest Description: You finally managed to save Dvalin. Is this where the story of the wind ends?

Back in Mondstadt, Amber shared that while Jean was away, the Knights of Favonius had been dealing with a coordinated attack by the monsters lurking nearby. Kaeya managed to gather some more information about the Abyss Order: they are united under a single leader, "The Prince/Princess", and it was this very leader who had devised the plot to turn Dvalin into a weapon of war. 

#### 8. Ending Note
##### Quest Description: Amber says that Jean is waiting for you at the Cathedral. Apparently, it's something to do with the Holy Lyre der Himmel...

There is still one more thing to do: to return the Holy Lyre der Himmel to the Church of Favonius. However, it is a little...broken.
The sight of the badly damaged Holy Lyre caused the pious Barbara to panic, but fortunately, with a little magic, Venti "fixed" the lyre before slipping away.

Unbeknowst to everyone, there was an ambush waiting for them outside the Cathedral. La Signora, The Fair Lady, Number Eight of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers, was waiting for the Anemo Archon. She forcefully took Venti's Gnosis, before leaving the injured Traveller and Venti behind.

When the Traveller woke up, they went after Venti who had already left for Windrise. There, Venti shared some confidential information about the world of Teyvet. For instance, a Gnosis is an internal magical focus that resonates directly with Celestia, a piece that every archon possessed. Visions are different as they are external magical foci which a small minority of people possess to channel elemental power. In truth, every wielder of a Vision, or Allogene, can attain godhood and ascend to Celestia. As for the Harbingers, they have been given god-like executive authority by the Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya, with strength surpassing that of other mortals. The Tsaritsa is one of The Seven, who reigns from the Zapolyarny Palace and the one person that the Fatui Harbingers all answer to. Venti once knew her well five hundred years ago, but lost contact after a certain catastrophe. It was a surprise to him that the Tsaritsa would plot to steal another archon's Gnosis. 

As for the Traveller's journey, Venti recommended that they head for Liyue next, Mondstadt's neighboring nation reigned over by the Geo Archon. There, they have a chance to meet the Geo Archon during their yearly Rite of Descension.
