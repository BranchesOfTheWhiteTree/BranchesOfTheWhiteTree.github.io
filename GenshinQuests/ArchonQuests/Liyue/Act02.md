## Introduction

"Farewell, Archaic Lord" is the second act of the Liyue Archon quest. This quest starts the day after Traveler and Paimon finish their visit with the Adepti to inform them of Rex Lapis's death, and to clear the accusation that they are the killer of Rex Lapis.

## An Organization Known as Wangsheng

### At the Northland Bank
After visiting the Adeptus, Traveler and Paimon return to Liyue and meet Ekaterina in the Northland Bank. The Liyue Qixing have hidden the Geo Archon's vessel away.

Ekatarina tells the Traveler and Paimon that he upheld his end of the agreement and found a way to break the stalemate.

Ekatarina informs the two to visit Childe at Liuli Pavilion - a flagship restaurant famous for the "Li" style of cooking in Liyue.

### At the Liuli Pavilion
On visiting Childe, he informs the two that he found a person who can help them solve the mystery of the Liyue Qixing's motive to hide the Geo Archon's vessel.

He takes the Traveler and Paimon into the restaurant and introduces them to Zhongli - a consultant to the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Zhongli is also a trusted associate of the Fatui.

As the name suggests, Wangsheng Funeral Parlor organizes burials, funerals, and performing last rites to the dead so that the dead may rest in peace.

Zhongli greets the Traveler and Paimon and tells that he has heard of the duo's tale in Mondstadt.

Zhongli tells the duo that he can get them close to Rex Lapis' vessel. Rex Lapis - the Geo Archon, is the Prime of Adepti, and whenever an Adepti die, Liyue holds a huge memorial serive (Rite of Passing) to mark the passing of the Adepti. Times have changed, and it is the time of the mankind, and the Adepti are living away from the city.

Nevertheless, he sees the lack of a memorial service from the Qixing to mark the passing of Rex Lapis to be a sacrilege. Regardless of whether the killer is caught or not, he says that the rites must be done.

Zhongli invites the Traveler and Paimon to assist him to help with the Rite of Passing since the two had dealing with the Anemo Archon. Seeing how the Traveler and Paimon have not many options, they accept the invite.

After the meal, Zhongli says that the Fatui can't exert their influence over Liyue due to it's prosperity, and due to the watchful eye of the Geo Archon, Adepti, and the Liyue Qixing. Zhongli believes Childe is trying to make use of the Wangsheng's connections to do something - although he neither wishes to know nor care about it. Childe also gave Zhongli a big sum of mora to use for the expenses of the Rite of Passing.

### At the Jade Mystery
Zhongli, Traveler, and Paimon visit Shitou of the Jade Mystery to buy a **Noctilucous Jade of Radiant Grade** from him. Shitou is known for asking customers to bet on his jade and make a fortune out of it.

He asks the group if they want to do a betting. They refuse and says that they are here to buy Noctilucous Jade. Shitou shows them three Jade samples. Paimon is confused on which one to pick and the traveler is doubtful of Shitou.

On asking Zhongli, he takes wants to thate them all. You only need one Jade for the Rite of passing, and his suggestion means forking three times the required mora. Zhongli cluelessly says he overlooked the mora part and he says he doesn't let Mora bound his decisions - something that most people normally have concerns on.

Traveler and Paimon wonder if Zhongli is filthy rich.

A fake noctilucous jade can be identified from a pure one only after it is crafted. And even then, it is easy to counter that by saying it could be a problem with crafting.

Zhongli says "A fool sees the pointer and misses the moon", meaning people can get lost looking at the patterns and facades (pointer) of the Jade and miss the brightness (moon). Noctilucous Jade glows blue and bright when exposed to Pyro. The stronger the flame, the brigher the glow and bluer the colour. Noctilucous Jade glows of high quality glow the brightest and bluest.

So, the group asks Shitou to give them small samples of all the three Jade samples for testing for which he agrees and gives them very thin and delicate samples of the jades. Although it is quite stingy from Shitou, it makes sense as it is an expense ore.

Zhongli suggests heating the ores with fire inside water helps to do the testing without breaking the samples.

When the traveler suggests trying to do the experiment at Wanmin Restaurant, Zhongli refuses saying it is a safety hazard. Instead, they all agree to go visit the "Meaty Tribe" of hilichurls in Dadaupa Gorge. They have a massive pot which they can use to do the testing.

### At Dadaupa Gorge

Zhongli hasn't been to Mondstadt in a long while and says that a **Mondstadt friend** of his would always bring few bottles of Dandelion wine when visiting him. He adds that Mondstadt liquor is much better than Sumeru's frigid snake wine.

Traveler defeats the hilichurls and start using the pot. They use the soup inside the pot as the Hydro Element protection for the Jades while they heat the pot with Pyro.

While testing the first and the second samples, the hilichurls span and try to interrupt. But the traveler takes care of them. Both the samples glow bright and blue.

However, the third sample was the brighest and bluest among all the Jade samples. They collectively agree to pick the third one.

### Back to the Jade Mystery

The trio goes to the Jade mystery and decide to biy the third Noctilucous Jade sample. Shitou agrees and asks why they wanted such a high-quality Jade.

Zhongli says that it is for the Rite of Parting for Rex Lapis.

A saddened Shitou says that it is hard to believe that Rex Lapis has passed away. While Jade Mystery has been on decline, he says they were under his protection all the time.

Shitou even says that when Rex Lapis visited his shop incognito 200 years ago, he bought a spoon from the shop and used it to sample the dishes of Liyue.

Feeling sentimental and nostalgic, Shitou sells the Jade for half the price because it was for the Rite of Passing. Zhongli assures that under the watchful eye of the Qixing, honest merchants like Shitou will prosper.

Zhongli takes the Jade and almost leaves without paying. Zhongli says he forgot and checks on his person, only to find he has no Mora.

This makes the Traveler and Paimon completely stunned - a Liyue Local who doesn't have money on his mind.

Fortunately, they have Childe's money to save. Next, they plan to go to Yujing Terrace. Traveler tells Zhongli to bring enough mora next time.

### At Yujing Terrace

Yujing terrace is where the Rite of Descension took place a few days ago. Zhongli rented this location to conduct the Rite of Parting with the Qixing's consent.

He has also arranged a Jewelsmith to process the Jade into the required implements, with Childe's money.

Paimon realizes that this is the crimescene of Rex Lapis's murder, and also, she finds it surprising that no one has chased around the Traveler and Paimon since their return from Jueyun Karst.

Zhongli says that the vessel of Rex Lapis is called an Exuvia, and adds that Qixing may have someone in their mind, and got all the evidences they need from the scene. He adds that these are Qixing matters and them trying to help the Qixing would add more complications.

Zhongli mentions that the Exuvia would be kept in the Golden House temporarily till the Rite of Passing preparations are done. Golden House is the **only Mora mint** in the entire of Teyvat. Zhongli says that since Rite of Passing is a "semi-official" event, he knows a few things.

Traveler says that both Childe and the Qixing have some ulterior motives. Zhongli says that might be the case. However, people can do a bit of exploitation in the capital of commerce. While contracts cannot be betrayed, he is fine with working a bit around the contract's remit.
